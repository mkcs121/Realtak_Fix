Fix volume louder after video pause and resume

(Searched many hours for the solution on google, tried all recommendations & non of them worked).
I ended my nightmare, by simply experimenting any ways possible / almost randomly. You might have seen this recommendation, that didn't work for you as well as for me, just BECAUSE of one stupid wrong step in the following process that many people posted. So here it is:

-> Go to Device Manager (I think you already know what I'm talking about but read until the end!!!)
--> Sound, video and game controllers
---> High Definition Audio Device - Update Driver Software...

AND NOW COMES THE MOST IMPORTANT PART... DO NOT CHOOSE "Search automatically for updated driver software" HELL NOOOOOOO!!!!! (most of posts say to click on that but it's not)

-----> Click on Browse my computer for driver software
------> Then, Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer
-------> Coming to this step you should have two options: "High Definition Audio Device" and "Realtek High Definition Audio"....... CHOOSE "High Definition Audio Device" !!!! -> Next (in this step a little box where says "Show compatible hardware" must be checked)
--------> A window with title "Update Driver Warning" will appear, pick "YES"
---------> After saying "Windows has successfully updated your driver software", click "Close" & if it asks to restart your computer, choose "YES"

This helped for me so try if nothing else did help you !
